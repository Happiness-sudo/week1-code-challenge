## 📂 Challenges
1. **Student Grade Generator**  
   - Takes student marks (0–100) and outputs the correct grade:  
     - A > 79  
     - B 60–79  
     - C 49–59  
     - D 40–49  
     - E < 40  

2. **Speed Detector**  
   - Takes the speed of a car as input.  
   - If speed < 70 → outputs `"Ok"`.  
   - Otherwise, adds 1 demerit point for every 5 km/s above the limit.  
   - If points > 12 → outputs `"License suspended"`.  

3. **Net Salary Calculator**  
   - Calculates net salary by considering:  
     - Basic salary + benefits → Gross salary  
     - Deductions: **PAYE (Tax), NHIF, NSSF**  
     - Net salary = Gross salary − (PAYE + NHIF + NSSF).
